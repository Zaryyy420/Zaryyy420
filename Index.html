            <h2>Welcome to FWDAR!</h2>
            <li>So what do we do with FWDAR?</li>
            <li>What is the meaning of FWDAR</li>
            <li>What is the use of FWDAR?</li>
            <hr>
            <p>- The FWDAR is an cleaning bot that is use to help you clean and to make it easier to put floor wax. So your energy wont be wasted you could multitask while the robot is waxing the floor, mop the floor and the last which is to scrub the floor.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>- The Meaning of FWDAR is Floor Wax Distributor Automated Robot, Floor Wax means the liquid that the thing pumps and also it is an Distributor it distributes liquid Floor Wax to the floor, It is Automated which autos its distribution on the liquid And lastly this is an Robot which is uses electrical components to do things.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>- The use of FWDAR is to put floor wax on the floor it magically wipes it off and the floor wax robot can be swap into a mopping bot which is useful isn't? and it can be also turn into a scrubbing bot to scrub dust on your dusty floor. This robot can distribute liquid which is already invented late 2000's and it has attachment to attachs things of course to add customization to the cleaning bot.</p>

            <p>This Experiment shows that…..<br><br>

Density = 1g/mL 
The 1mL (millimeter) is equivalent to the 1g (grams) due to density so if we calculate the Drop Rate per Second (Drps) it shows that:<br><br>

•Let's assume that the container has 180mL water.
<br>
<br>
D = 180g = 180mL
<br>
<br>
Drps = 180mL / 1s
<br>
<br>
Drps = 1mL per second
<br>
<br>
•But this small pump is not working due to slow rpm (Rotation per minute) and it isn't sucking up water upwards so I had to make it downwards so it could follow the siphon of the water and the water from the pump and on the container are leaking everywhere because of the not sealed part body of the pump which is the plastic bottle caps.

            <p>This information gave us…<br><br>

The Radio Control Board signifies that a extra component can be put in but due to having more connections the voltage output of the board will be disrupted and it will make the component move slower because of low voltage input.

            <p>This illustration gave us…<br><br>

The cans of “Del Monte Pineapple” can be use for containing floor wax and it doesn't break easily due to it having an metal body which is made up of tin (a type of metal).
